# DiscordAutoAck
Simple script to ignore all messages from certain servers. Useful when servers use lots of role pings.

Download a zipped release from [here](https://github.com/Drowrin/DiscordAutoAck/releases).

On first run, config.yml will be generated. Fill it out with your discord token and guild (server) ids to ignore, then run again. As long as the script remains running, those servers will automatically be marked as read.

Token should be pasted in the file after the colon, without quotes. Guild IDs should be pasted in the file within the brackets, separated by commas, no quotes.

[This](https://github.com/TheRacingLion/Discord-SelfBot/wiki/Discord-Token-Tutorial) has good instructions for getting your discord token.

To get server ids, enable developer mode in discord appearance settings. Then, right click on a server and "copy id".
